## 🛠️ Design Decisions and Challenges

- **Glassmorphism UI:**  
  Chose glassmorphism to give the dashboard a clean and futuristic look without relying on third-party UI libraries like MUI or Tailwind.

- **Frontend-Only Persistence:**  
  Since no backend is implemented, LocalStorage was used to simulate data saving, ensuring that user-added incidents persist across page reloads.

- **Responsive Design:**  
  The app was built with mobile-first principles in mind, ensuring that the dashboard looks great on both mobile devices and desktops.
